# Python Projects

Welcome to the `Python_1` repository! This repository includes several Python projects designed to demonstrate a variety of programming concepts and practical applications. Below is a summary of the projects contained in this repository:

## Projects Overview

### Hangman

A classic word-guessing game where players try to guess a hidden word letter by letter. The game provides feedback on correct and incorrect guesses and continues until the word is guessed or the player runs out of attempts.

### Coffee Machine

Simulates a coffee vending machine that allows users to select different types of coffee, manage resources like water, milk, and coffee beans, and handle payments. The simulation provides a practical example of resource management and user interaction.

### OOP Quiz Generator

Demonstrates object-oriented programming by creating a quiz generator. This project allows users to create and manage quizzes, add questions, and evaluate answers, showcasing how to apply OOP principles in a practical application.

### Blackjack

A simple implementation of the classic card game Blackjack. In this game, players aim to achieve a hand value as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it, competing against the dealer. Itâ€™s a great example of game logic and probability in programming.
